However, after attending a training session on the CAPS Model, she learned to identify different personality types, including the Tank. The next time she encountered Alex, she remembered to stay calm and assertive. Instead of reacting defensively, she acknowledged his concerns and redirected the conversation. This time, Sarah felt empowered, and by the end of the call, Alex was more receptive. She realized that understanding personality types could transform her interactions. Now, Sarah approaches difficult customers with confidence, knowing she can handle any situation that arises.",
