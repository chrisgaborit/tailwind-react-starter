Sarah felt her heart race, recalling past experiences where she struggled to maintain composure. However, she remembered the CAPS Model and took a deep breath. Instead of reacting defensively, she acknowledged Alex's frustration and asked clarifying questions. This shift in approach transformed the conversation.

Now, she confidently applies this knowledge daily, turning potential conflicts into opportunities for resolution.",
