SESSION ONE 
 Introduction 

 
5 
 
 
What is Internal Consulting? 
 
Any  time  you  try  to  influence,  change  or  improve  something,  but  have  no  direct  control  over  the 
implementation,  you  are  in  a  consulting  situation.    If  you  have  direct  control,  you  are  managing,  not 
consulting.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The consultant’s lack of direct control and authority are what make this role challenging. 
 
In addition, a consultant deals with two types of change:  
 
1. A structural, policy or procedural change (substance) 
2. The change in one person or people who learn something new (process) 
 
The  first  of  these,  a  substantive  change  to  a  system  within  the  organisation,  is  the  most  straightforward, 
though  it  faces  all  the  challenges  that  any  workplace  change  must  confront  (e.g.  teething  problems, 
tuning problems, timing problems etc). 
 
The  second  type,  how  people  go  about  the  process  of  making  the  changes,  is  less  predictable,  and 
often more challenging for the consultant.   
 
The interpersonal relationships of  people involved on the  project need careful  managing to ensure that 
everyone is willing to engage, tolerate differences, learn and cooperate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Approaches to Internal Consulting 
An internal consultant works inside one part of the organisation to help another 
part of the organisation. 
Help usually means solving a problem, enacting a change, giving advice or, in 
some cases, working on large-scale transformations. 
What makes the consultant’s job unique is that internal consultant’s work with 
people over whom they have no direct authority or control.  
(Meslin, 2007) 

 
6 
 
 
 
Directive vs. Non-Directive Consulting 
 
The degree to which an internal consultant gets involved in the client’s actual operations and decisions 
can vary, from relatively nondirective to highly directive.  Some of these variations are outlined below.   
           (Lippett & Lippett, The Consulting Process in Action, 1978) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
7 
 
 
Three Approaches 
 
Along  the  scale  of  directiveness  there  are  three  general  positions  a  consultant  may  choose  (or  be 
chosen) to take: as a pair of hands, as an expert or as a collaborator.  Each may be appropriate for 
different consulting situations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
8 
 
 
Three Approaches (cont) 
 
1.  Pair of hands 
At the low level of directiveness, the client retains almost all of the control of the project, determining the 
problem  and the solution, with the consultant implementing the solution.  The consultant is expected to 
apply  specialised  knowledge  to  implement  action  plans  toward  the  achievement  of  goals  defined  by 
the client.  
 
Difficulties can arise when the client’s ideas and the consultant’s expertise suggest different directions for 
the project. Also the full scope of the consultant’s specialised knowledge may be under-used because 
of the nature of the client’s plans and pre-conceived solutions. 
 
2.  Expert 
At  the  high  end  of  directiveness,  the  expert  consultant  assumes  the  majority  of  control  for  the  project.  
The  client  may  make  suggestions  but  the  consultant  advises  the  client  what  would  be  best  based  on 
their expertise.  
 
Advantages  of  this  approach  are  that  it  frees  line  management  up  from  involvement,  and  puts  the 
project in the hands of someone who is acknowledged as having superior expertise. Disadvantages can 
arise due to the expert’s lack of familiarity with the on-the-ground aspects of the project, and truncated 
lines of communication with those affected. 
 
3.  Collaborator 
This approach sits somewhere midway along the directiveness scale.  It uses both the consultant’s expert 
knowledge and the client’s knowledge of the operation and process. Decisions regarding actions to 
take and implementation are all shared responsibilities, with equal attention given to both the technical 
issues and the human interactions involved with this.  
 
This can be a more satisfying way of proceeding, with all ideas deliberated together and joint decisions 
made.    However,  it  can  be  more  time-consuming  and,  if  personalities  are  not  congenial,  subject  to 
conflict.  It  may  also  be  hard  to  determine  responsibility  and  accountability  unless  these  are  carefully 
spelled out. 
 
The preferred mode of operation for most internal consultants is the collaborative approach  as it draws 
on a larger base of expertise, both theirs and the client’s, to apply to the project.

  Understanding the Client’s Business Issues – External Conditions 
 
Business issues usually arise as a result of external conditions, organisational responses and the functional 
challenges presented by the client’s specific area/department.  Developing your awareness of these 
issues helps you to “stand in the client’s shoes” so you can better tune the advice and consulting services 
you offer them. 
 
External  conditions are   industry-wide   trends   that   affect  the   organisation.   As   a   general   rule,   the 
organisation has little or no control over external conditions. They include: 
 
Competitive practices 
Financial conditions (e.g. inflation, recession, interest rates, exchange rates etc) 
The state of the local, regional, national and/or global economy 
Consumer demand and buying patterns 
Federal  and  state  laws  (e.g.  regulation  and  deregulation,  tax laws,  trade  policy,  changes  in 
legislation, compliance laws etc) 
Cost and availability of materials 
Availability and quality of labour, union activity etc. 
 
 
Exercise: An External Condition 
 
Identify one example of an external condition your client must respond to: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 
10 
 
 
Understanding the Client’s Business Issues – Organisational Responses 
 
Organisational  responses are  the  strategies  an  organisation  undertakes  on  an  overall  basis.    Typically, 
these strategies are in response to the external conditions the organisation is facing.   
 
These responses might include:  
 
New objectives to be more profitable or productive, or to increase sales 
Reorganisation/downsizing or mergers/acquisitions 
Centralisation or decentralisation 
Open a new channel to market (technology based etc) 
Use of work teams 
New product development or diversification 
 
Exercise: Organisational response 
 
State  one  overall  strategy  your  client  has  developed  as  an  organisational  response  to the  external 
condition cited above: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 
11 
 
 
Understanding the Client’s Business Issues – Functional Challenges 
 
Functional challenges are the third level of business issues.  They reflect the pressures faced by individuals 
and work groups within the organisation.   
 
For example: 
 
For customer service: increase customer satisfaction, reduce cost per service calls 
For sales: increase sales volume, prospect more productively 
For marketing: differentiate amongst products, devise new pricing strategies 
For IT: manage data more efficiently, upgrade communication resources 
 
Exercise: A functional challenge 
 
Describe  a  challenge  your  client  and  his/her  colleagues  are  facing  that  has  been  brought  on  by  the 
external conditions and organisational response you noted above:

SESSION TWO 
Earn the Right 

 
13 
 
 
EARN THE RIGHT 
 
 
Phase 1: Earn the Right 
 
Phase 1 sets the foundation for your consulting relationship.  In it, you consciously do things to build trust 
and rapport so that  your client comes to view you  as someone in whom they can have confidence. In 
this phase you are demonstrating the three key skills Internal Consulting Skills. They are: 
 
• Technical Skills 
• Interpersonal Skills 
• Consulting Skills 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 
14 
 
 
Internal Consultant Skills 
 
The end goal of the consulting model is for the internal consultant to create change – to both substance 
and relationship.  Every time you consult to a person or group, they make a choice based on your input.   
 
 
 
To enable your clients to make the right choices, you need to be proficient in 3 kinds of skills: 
 
1. Technical skills 
Your expertise in a specific aspect of the business is your first requirement in a consulting role.  This will 
be based your experience in operational, management or organisational development functions. 
 
2. Interpersonal skills 
These  are  the  skills  that  reflect  your  ability  to  relate  with  others:  how  you  express  yourself,  respond, 
give support or disagree reasonably within the contexts of a relationship. 
 
3. Consulting skills 
These skills  are  in  addition  to  your  technical  and  interpersonal  skills,  and  dictate  your  ability  to  enter 
into, carry out and successfully complete consulting projects. 
 
  

 
15 
 
 
Exercise:  
 
In  triads,  brainstorm the  two  different  sets  of  interpersonal  and  consulting  skills  required  by  an  internal 
consultant. Record on flip chart and present.

Building Trust 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To  achieve  a  collaborative  relationship,  trust  is  essential.  Trust  depends  on  the  internal  consultant 
developing and sustaining an image and reputation with the client that is high on the following factors: 
 
• Familiarity/similarity 
• Openness  
• Credibility 
• Dependability 
• Predictability 
• Valuing common good 
• Emotional safety 
 
 
 
  
 
Trust 
Is a key component in any successful relationship 
Develops over time 
Once lost, is hard to regain 
Includes giving something of yourself, being genuinely 
interested in the other person and seeing communication as a 
shared experience
