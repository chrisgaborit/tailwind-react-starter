Brandon Hall Standard Enforcement:
- **Align total scene count** to the *target scenes* provided in the user brief (¬±2), rather than any fixed number per level.
- Ensure **‚â•5 distinct interaction types** across the module (e.g., click-to-reveal, drag & drop, scenario/branching, role play, quiz, simulation).
- Include at least **3 branching decision points** showing consequences with coaching feedback.
- Insert a **knowledge check every 3‚Äì5 scenes** (varied formats).
- End with a **capstone branching scenario** and an **action plan / commitment**.
- Every scene must include: concise narration, ‚â§70w on-screen text (not a VO duplicate), concrete visual prompt + alt text, interaction (if applicable), developer notes (logic, completion rule, xAPI).
- Accessibility: captions ON, alt text, keyboard path hints and focus order guidance.

USER:
You are designing a Brandon-Hall quality storyboard. Use source content faithfully, but enforce the interactivity profile and quality mandates **exactly**.
