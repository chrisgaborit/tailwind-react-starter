Introduction

5
What is Internal Consulting?
Any  time  you  try  to  influence,  change  or  improve  something,  but  have  no  direct  control  over  the
implementation,  you  are  in  a  consulting  situation.    If  you  have  direct  control,  you  are  managing,  not
consulting.
The consultant’s lack of direct control and authority are what make this role challenging.
In addition, a consultant deals with two types of change:
1.Astructural, policy or procedural change (substance)
2.The change in one person or people who learn something new (process)
The  first  of  these,  a  substantive  change  to  a  system  within  the  organisation,  is  the  most  straightforward,
though  it  faces  all  the  challenges  that  any  workplace  change  must  confront  (e.g.  teething  problems,
tuning problems, timing problems etc).
The  second  type,  how  people  go  about  the  process  of  making  the  changes,  is  less  predictable,  and
often more challenging for the consultant.
The  interpersonal  relationships  of  people  involved  on  the  project  need  careful  managing  to  ensure  that
everyone is willing to engage, tolerate differences, learn and cooperate.
An internal consultant works inside onepart of the organisation to help another
part of the organisation.
Help usually means solving a problem, enacting a change, giving advice or, in
some cases, working on large-scale transformations.
What makes the consultant’s job unique is that internal consultant’s work with
people over whom they have no direct authority or control.
(Meslin, 2007)

Approaches to Internal Consulting
Directive vs. Non-DirectiveConsulting
The degree to which an  internal consultant gets involved in the client’s actual operations and decisions
can vary, from relatively nondirective to highly directive.  Some of these variations are outlined below.
(Lippett & Lippett,The Consulting Process in Action, 1978)

7
Three Approaches
Along  the  scale  of  directiveness  there  are  three  general  positions  a  consultant  may  choose  (or  be
chosen) to take: as a pair of hands, as an expert or as a collaborator.  Each may be appropriate for
different consulting situations.

8
Three Approaches (cont)
1.  Pair of hands
At the low level of directiveness, the client retains almost all of the control of the project, determining the
problem and the solution, with the consultant implementing the solution.   The consultant is expected to
apply  specialised  knowledge  to  implementaction  plans  toward  the  achievement  of  goals  defined  by
the client.
Difficulties can arise when the client’s ideas and the consultant’s expertise suggest different directions for
the  project.  Also  the  full  scope  of  the  consultant’s  specialised  knowledgemay  be  under-used  because
of the nature of the client’s plans and pre-conceived solutions.
2.  Expert
At  the  high  end  of  directiveness,  the  expert  consultant  assumes  the  majority  of  control  for  the  project.
The  client  may  make  suggestions  but  the  consultant  advises  the  client  what  would  be  best  based  on
their expertise.
Advantages  of  this  approach  are  that  it  frees  line  management  up  from  involvement,  and  puts  the
project in the hands of someone who is acknowledged as having superior expertise. Disadvantages can
arise due to the expert’s lack of familiarity with the on-the-ground aspects of the project, and truncated
lines of communication with those affected.
3.  Collaborator
This approach sits somewhere midway along the directivenessscale.  It uses both the consultant’s expert
knowledge  and  the  client’s  knowledge  of  the  operation  and  process.  Decisions  regarding  actions  to
take and implementation are all shared responsibilities, with equal attention given to both the technical
issuesand the human interactions involved with this.
This can be a more satisfying way of proceeding, with all ideas deliberated together and joint decisions
made.    However,  it  can  be  more  time-consuming  and,  if  personalities  are  not  congenial,  subject  to
conflict.  It  may  also  be  hard  to  determine  responsibility  and  accountability  unless  these  are  carefully
spelled out.
The preferred mode  of  operation for most internal consultants is the collaborative approach as it draws
on a larger base of expertise, both theirs and the client’s, to apply to the project.

9
Understanding the Client’s Business Issues–External Conditions
Business issues usually arise as a result of external conditions, organisational responses and the functional
challenges  presented  by  theclient’s  specific  area/department.    Developing  your  awareness  of  these
issues helps you to “stand in the client’s shoes” so you can better tune the advice and consulting services
you offer them.
External   conditionsare   industry-wide   trends   that   affect  the   organisation.   As   a   general   rule,   the
organisation has little or no control over external conditions. They include:
Competitive practices
Financial conditions (e.g. inflation, recession, interest rates, exchange rates etc)
The state of the local, regional, national and/or global economy
Consumer demand and buying patterns
Federal  and  state  laws  (e.g.  regulation  and  deregulation,  taxlaws,  trade  policy,  changes  in
legislation, compliance laws etc)
Cost and availability of materials
Availability and qualityof labour, union activity etc.
Exercise: An External Condition
Identify one example of an external condition your client must respond to:

10
Understanding the Client’s Business Issues–Organisational Responses
Organisational  responsesare  the  strategies  an  organisation  undertakes  on  an  overall  basis.    Typically,
these strategies are in response to the external conditions the organisation is facing.
These responses might include:
New objectives to be more profitable or productive,or to increase sales
Reorganisation/downsizing or mergers/acquisitions
Centralisation or decentralisation
Open a new channel to market (technology based etc)
Use of work teams
New product development or diversification
Exercise: Organisational response
State  one  overall  strategy  your  client  has  developed  as  an  organisational  response  to  the  external
condition cited above:

11
Understanding the Client’s Business Issues–Functional Challenges
Functional challengesare the third level of business issues.  They reflect the pressures faced by individuals
and work groups within the organisation.
For example:
For customer service: increase customer satisfaction, reduce cost per service calls
For sales: increase sales volume, prospect more productively
For marketing: differentiate amongst products, devise new pricing strategies
For IT: manage data more efficiently, upgrade communication resources
Exercise: A functional challenge
Describe  a  challenge  your  client  andhis/her  colleagues  are  facing  that  has  been  brought  on  by  the
external conditions and organisational response you noted above:

EARN THE RIGHT
Phase 1: Earn the Right
Phase 1 sets the foundation for your consulting relationship.  In it, you consciously do things to build trust
and  rapport  so that  your  client  comes  to  view  you  as  someone  in  whom they  can  have  confidence.In
this phase you are demonstrating the three keyskills Internal Consulting Skills. They are:
Technical Skills
Interpersonal Skills
Consulting Skills

14
Internal ConsultantSkills
The end goal of the consulting model is for the internal consultant to create change–to both substance
and relationship.  Every time you consult to a person or group, they make a choice based on your input.
To enable your clients to make the rightchoices, you need to be proficient in 3 kinds of skills:
1.Technical skills
Your expertise in a specific aspect of the business is your first requirement in a consulting role.  This will
be based your experience in operational, management or organisationaldevelopment functions.
2.Interpersonal skills
These  are  the  skills  that  reflect  your  ability  to  relate  with  others:  how  you  express  yourself,  respond,
give support or disagree reasonably within the contexts of a relationship.
3.Consulting skills
These  skillsare  in  addition  to  your  technical  and  interpersonal  skills,  and  dictate  your  ability  to  enter
into, carry out and successfully complete consulting projects.
