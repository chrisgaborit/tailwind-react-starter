--- CONTEXT EXAMPLES (RAG) ---
--- START OF EXAMPLE 1 ---
Scene 306: Debt is a ‘cheaper’ option for companies to raise funds.
Debt is a ‘cheaper’ option for companies to raise funds.

Scene 307: Scene 307
Providers of debt have a more senior claim over the entity’s assets or security over specific assets

Scene 308: Scene 308
An entity’s ability to access debt is dependent upon the existing debt burden and earnings relative to debt

Scene 309: Scene 309
It is additionally supported by unencumbered real assets that can be pledged as security

Scene 310: Scene 310
Note: Related party investments or loans may not always be carried at fair or realisable values. Unless the credit quality of the related party is known, a view on the materiality of assets must be determined.

Scene 311: Scene 311
Now, we need to zoom in on the second topic “Debt/Third-party creditors” and then transition to the next slide – starting with provider of debt.

Scene 312: Scene 312
Start with the background image and then fade out and bring in the pointers in the same format as equity.

Scene 313: Start with the image and text, and then the three examples one by one
Start with the image and text, and then the three examples one by one

Scene 314: Next button to go to the next slide.

Scene 156: ETHICAL FOUNDATIONS
ETHICAL FOUNDATIONS

Scene 157: Scene 157
Ethical foundations are the fundamental values or principles that resonate with you, with the first being to ‘know thyself’. Spend time reflecting on your values and how you interpret what is right or good.

Scene 158: Scene 158
Like Aristotle, you may find that you want to cultivate virtues – practising certain habits – to extend and build your character into your best version of yourself.

Scene 159: Scene 159
Of course, this is likely to take a lifetime, so don’t be disappointed if you don’t meet all your own high standards every now and again.

Scene 160: Scene 160
Another ethical foundation is to know and understand your industry, your profession’s and your organisation’s ethical foundations.

Scene 161: Scene 161
These ethical foundations are often outlined in codes of ethics or conduct and are covered in detail in a later unit.

Scene 162: Scene 162
Codes can provide an effective resource to assist in making better ethical decisions.

QUALITY MANDATES
- Include: **Pronunciation Guide**, **Table of Contents**, and **Welcome & Learning Objectives** (first four).
- Provide **3–5 Learning Outcomes** and ensure the ToC aligns with ~20 scenes.
- Each scene: concise VO, OST ≤ 70w, visual with concrete AI prompt + alt text, interaction (if applicable), dev notes (logic/xAPI).
- Accessibility: captions ON by default; include keyboard path hints where relevant.
- Use UK English throughout.
- Aim for Brandon Hall / LearnX calibre: scenario-based practice, spaced retrieval, meaningful feedback, authentic language, and practicality.

OUTPUT RULES
- Return a single **JSON object only** (no markdown fences, no commentary).
- Use the exact schema above and include the first four scenes in order.
