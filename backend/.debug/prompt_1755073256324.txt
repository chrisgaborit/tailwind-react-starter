- Purpose of the LICOP
- 6 core principles
- Codifies good practice
- Key areas that the code covers
- Overall message – customer at centre of the experience
- Contains timeframe guidelines to be met by Insurance teams

2 |
Purpose of the LICOP
The Life Insurance Code of Practice (LICOP) was designed as a commitment to high standards of customer
service across the Life Insurance industry.
At the heart of LICOP is a promise to provide our customers with an experience that is honest, fair and
transparent.
The LICOP promotes service that is timely, delivered with respect and with information that is easily
understood.
Adopting these principles and adhering to the LICOP is an important step in our life insurance journey.
3 |
Background of LICOP
Tell me more about the Life Insurance Code of Practice…
The LICOP was issued in October 2016 by the Financial Services Council (FSC). It is an industry guideline
that outlines minimum conditions and expectations for us to meet across our life insurance practice. It covers
everything from sales practices and marketing to underwriting processes and claims management as well as
much more.
These standards aim to:
• Promote high standards of service to customers
• Provide a benchmark of consistency within the industry
• Establish a framework for professional behaviour and responsibilities
Our commitment to our customers continues to be at the forefront of everything we do. The LICOP provides
us with an opportunity to continue to develop our customer’s experience with AMP life insurance.
4 |
Key areas of the Code
The LICOP “codified” what good practice (minimum conditions and standards) is in life insurance. Key areas
of focus in the code include:
Underwriting and insurance administration
Claims
Product design
Sales
Marketing
Complaints
Supporting customers with additional needs and customers experiencing financial difficulty
5 |
Timeframes to be met by our teams
The LICOP outlines a number of timeframes for specific interactions or actions to occur within. At AMP, we aim
to complete these actions well within these timeframes. We use our reporting tools to monitor how we are
going in meeting these timeframes.
Key timeframes to be met:
6 |
Timeframes to be met by our teams
7 |
Collaboration of teams and which branch to select
At AMP our teams collaborate together to provide the best experience to our customers. Whilst some of the
code commitments or timeframes may seem specific to a team, it is important that we can appreciate as a
whole the commitments we make to customers.
Three branches to choose from:
1. Underwriting and Insurance Admin staff members
2. Claims staff members
3. Other Insurance staff members (as well as our contact centres and AMP Assist staff members)
It is recommended that staff complete the branch relevant to them, but note that they can complete all 3
branches if they wish.
8 |
Branch 1: general
• 1 internal scenario (i.e. colleagues chatting about code and what this means
for their team). Scenario in product team where they are preparing for a
product annual review – focus on code requirements they must meet for this
(e.g. review of medical definitions), plus also the development of a customer
communication. Focus on plain language.
• 1 external scenario (two instances) – respond to access to information
request. Raise this with Admin who complete it and send to customer.
Requests for access to information must be met within 10 days.
• 1 internal/external scenario (complaints) – managing a customer complaint
related to AMP Assist selling insurance – what should happen? Spin this into
a positive scenario (i.e. what could have the consultant done better?)
9 |
Branch 1, scenario 1
Relates to Section 3 of LICOP
New insurance team member starts and is receiving base info they need to know about the Code. The team
should be “Proposition” (i.e. product team). They will need to help with a PDS review and roll. Scenario
should touch on a few key things: use of plain language, customer testing to ensure ease of understanding,
review of medical definitions.
Should also show a review of communications issued to customers to ensure requirements in 3.4 are met.
10 |
Branch 1, scenario 2
Relates to Section 14 of LICOP
TWO INSTANCES:
ONE: Customer calls contact centre requesting access to information gathered about them. Information
requested is about reports gathered about them during underwriting process (from independent service
providers).
This should be a simple scenario – consultant notes the request and processes this.
TWO: Customer calls UW team asking for access to information (Independent service provider reports that
have been gathered about them during claims time). It is determined that the information gathered about
them is a bit sensitive and would best be delivered by a doctor. The UW assessor informs the customer that
they will be sending the reports to their doctor and to please make an appointment with them.
11 |
Branch 1, scenario 3
Relates to Section 4 of LICOP
Complaint with AMP Assist and selling insurance.
Customer calls and makes a complaint about a policy that has been sold to them via AMP Assist. I would
suggest that the conversation / activity could flow with the customer complaining about a few items from the
below list
Use activity/scenario to determine reasons why customers would complain about selling or marketing of
insurance, including:
Marketing:
- Must be clear and not misleading
- Appropriate use of images
- Statements are consistent with relevant policy
Sales (AMP Assist):
- Minimum information must be disclosed to customer (e.g. premium, features, benefits, exclusions, limits
and cooling off periods).
- No pressure selling
- Obtain evidence customer has consented to purchase the policy
- Rules / guidelines around replacing an existing life insurance policy with another insurer.
12 |
Branch 2: Claims
• Would be good for the scenario to show a day-in-the-life of a claims assessor.
13 |
Branch 2: Claims
• The activity should include all of the above timeframes and show a flow from a
customer first calling to discuss making a claim to a final decision being made.
• Maybe there could be two scenarios or activities here – one to show IP claims
decision, one to show all other claims decisions.
• This section should be interactive but succinct.
• Note that the following slides outline what information should be included in the
eLearning. However, how this is structured in scenarios / activities I will leave up
to the guidance of the experts.
14 |
Branch 2, scenario 1
Relates to Section 8 of LICOP
Show the claims lifecycle – perhaps this can be via a series of “interactions” or activities
How we support you when you make a claims: (8. 24-26)
- Compassion and respect
- Acknowledge is a difficult time for customers
- Work with customers who are having difficulty providing information
- Income related claims – special requirements (8.26)
When a customer makes a claim:
- Not discourage them from making a claim
- Consider all features of the policy to which the claim relates in order to ensure that the customer is
claiming for all available benefits under the policy.
- Within 10 business days of being notified of the claim, explain to the customer their cover and claim
process, including why we request certain information from them, and any waiting period prior to a claim
being paid. Provide them with contact details they can use.
- Keep customer informed of their claim status / progress every 20 days. Respond to requests for access to
info within 10 days.
15 |
Branch 2, scenario 1
What AMP requires to assess a claim:
- Only ask for relevant information
- May ask for general authority to gain information from other sources (e.g. doctor)
- Request the information needed early in the process
- Additional requirements for income related claims (section 8.9)
- Requirements for interviews and surveillance (8.11 and 8.12)
Claims decisions and benefit payments:
- Delay in meeting timeframes: what is an unexpected circumstance? (8.14)
- Communicate claims decision within 10 business days (8.15)
- Income related claims, decision to be made within 2 months (8.16)
- All other claims, decision to be made within 6 months. (8.17)
- Decline a claim – what AMP will do (8.19)
16 |
Branch 2, scenario 1
Income related benefits:
- 8.21-23 – can this please be made succinct and included as a reminder for staff (particularly section 8.22
and 23)
Urgent Financial needs: (8.27-30)
- Customers can make a request for urgent financial need support.
- Request relevant documentation for this (8.28)
- If in urgent need, can request for faster process
- Notify customer about decision within 5 business days
17 |
Branch 3: UW and Insurance Admin
• Go through underwriting process with a customer – maybe a TPS (telepersonal
statement) interview? Show different things for consideration and gathering
internal and external outstandings. Maybe show UW having to reach out for
information prior to making decision? (both internally to a policy colleague, and
externally to a doctor). After decision show flow through to IA for the
administration process.
• Second scenario – refund of application (this is insurance administration).
Customer is having application refunded – provide reasons that this can occur.
Refund must occur within 15 business days.
• Also show a request for info coming in and being responded to. This would be
from IA.
18 |
Branch 3: UW and Insurance Admin
19 |
Branch 3, scenario 1
This relates to section 5 of the LICOP
Underwriting team receive an application for insurance cover. They must gather required information about
the customer so that they can assess the application.
- Duty of disclosure – purpose and requirement
- May require to gather information / have discussions with external parties (e.g. doctors)
- May require additional information from an independent service provider (include 5.7 and 5.8 information
here)
- When have all information from customer, internally (e.g. policy advice) and externally (e.g. doctors), a
decision can be made on the insurance application. This decision must be communicated within 5
business days.
- Non disclosure process (5.20) – I think this information should also be included.
20 |
Branch 3, scenario 2
This relates to section 6 of the LICOP
Customer contacts AMP to cancel their life insurance policy. Process follows whereby Insurance Admin staff
member (IA) checks the customer's policy and determines if a refund is to be applied. If so, this must be
refunded within 15 business days.
Scenario extension: when customer calls to cancel their policy, they also request access to information
gathered about them during the UW process. This request is reviewed and responded to within 10 business
days.
21 |
Final sections – all
• Additional needs – show an example of Contact Centre helping additional needs
customer – maybe a simple scenario like asking for access to information and
maybe a payment of a premium? (i.e. 2 examples). One example should be
English as a second language, the other can be an elderly customer. Add
hyperlink to the AMP policy.
• Complaints process – key things to remember during complaints – maybe short
overview of fact that customer comes first, complaints procedures and
timeframes to be met within.
22 |
Final sections – all
Incidents and breaches - “An Incident is an event, error, control failure, or business issue that
has resulted (or could result) in a loss, in reputational damage or in a breach of AMP’s
regulatory obligations. Breaches of the FSC Life Insurance Code of Practice are to be recorded
as incidents.
Incidents are recorded in the Incident Management Database and are reviewed using the
Incident Management processes described in the Enterprise Risk Management Handbook.
The management of incidents aims to identify the root cause of the incident to allow for actions
to minimise the impact of existing incident, identify improvements to reduce the likelihood of
future occurrence of incidents and to remediate losses to customers.
In addition, the incident management process includes consideration of all incidents at the
Incident Working Group and, where warranted, at the Breach Review Committee to determine
whether breaches of regulation are significant and are therefore reportable to regulators such
as ASIC or APRA. The same process is to be used to determine whether a breach of the FSC
Life Insurance Code of Practice is significant and is reportable to the FSC Life Code
Compliance Committee.”
23 |
ALL
Supporting customers with additional needs (Section 7)
Customer calls AMP and is struggling to use English. The contact centre staff member offers the use of a
translation service for the call. The customer accepts and suggests the language they would like to
communicate in.
This is just one example of how we can help customers.
I think this section should be about our 4 types of additional needs categories:
- Preference to speak in another language
- Elderly
- Disabled
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Perhaps we can have an activity about how we help each customer group – maybe a way of helping that is
dragged and dropped under each group OR a flash card of a way of helping followed by a selection of the
different groups it applies to?
Kate is key contact for this area so can work on this together.
24 |
ALL
Complaints (Section 9)
Two key “minimum” timeframes for responding to complaints:
- Respond within 90 days for policies owned by a superannuation trustee
- Respond within 45 days for policies not owned by a superannuation trustee
Reminders for staff about best ways to avoid complaints:
- Open communication with customers
- Keep well within timeframes outlined in code (e.g. timeframes for specific interactions or actions).
- Clear written communications
25 |
ALL
Raising breaches of the Code
I will supply you with the key contact to discuss this with – she will have a succinct blurb about this J (I don’t
have the process offhand exactly – but basically a staff member should raise to their business leader who
triages it up to our risk team for incident management. If needed, this committee will then raise this up to the
breach committee who will raise it externally as required).

Thank you

Branch 3: UW and Insurance Admin
•Go through underwriting process with a customer – maybe a TPS (telepersonal 
statement) interview? Show different things for consideration and gathering 
internal and external outstandings. Maybe show UW having to reach out for 
information prior to making decision? (both internally to a policy colleague, and 
externally to a doctor). After decision show flow through to IA for the 
administration process. 
•Second scenario – refund of application (this is insurance administration). 
Customer is having application refunded – provide reasons that this can occur. 
Refund must occur within 15 business days.  
•Also show a request for info coming in and being responded to. This would be 
from IA.

Branch 3: UW and Insurance Admin
19   |

Branch 3, scenario 1
This relates to section 5 of the LICOP
Underwriting team receive an application for insurance cover. They must gather required information about 
the customer so that they can assess the application.  
-Duty of disclosure – purpose and requirement
-May require to gather information / have discussions with external parties (e.g. doctors)
-May require additional information from an independent service provider (include 5.7 and 5.8 information 
here)
-When have all information from customer, internally (e.g. policy advice) and externally (e.g. doctors), a 
decision can be made on the insurance application. This decision must be communicated within 5 
business days.  
-Non disclosure process (5.20) – I think this information should also be included. 
20   |

Branch 3, scenario 2
This relates to section 6 of the LICOP
Customer contacts AMP to cancel their life insurance policy. Process follows whereby Insurance Admin staff 
member (IA) checks the customer's policy and determines if a refund is to be applied. If so, this must be 
refunded within 15 business days. 
Scenario extension: when customer calls to cancel their policy, they also request access to information 
gathered about them during the UW process. This request is reviewed and responded to within 10 business 
days.

Final sections – all
•Additional needs – show an example of Contact Centre helping additional needs 
customer – maybe a simple scenario like asking for access to information and 
maybe a payment of a premium? (i.e. 2 examples). One example should be 
English as a second language, the other can be an elderly customer. Add 
hyperlink to the AMP policy. 
•Complaints process – key things to remember during complaints – maybe short 
overview of fact that customer comes first, complaints procedures and 
timeframes to be met within.

Final sections – all
Incidents and breaches -  “An Incident is an event, error, control failure, or business issue that 
has resulted (or could result) in a loss, in reputational damage or in a breach of AMP’s 
regulatory obligations. Breaches of the FSC Life Insurance Code of Practice are to be recorded 
as incidents.
Incidents are recorded in the Incident Management Database and are reviewed using the 
Incident Management processes described in the Enterprise Risk Management Handbook. 
The management of incidents aims to identify the root cause of the incident to allow for actions 
to minimise the impact of existing incident, identify improvements to reduce the likelihood of 
future occurrence of incidents and to remediate losses to customers.
In addition, the incident management process includes consideration of all incidents at the 
Incident Working Group and, where warranted, at the Breach Review Committee to determine 
whether breaches of regulation are significant and are therefore reportable to regulators such 
as ASIC or APRA. The same process is to be used to determine whether a breach of the FSC 
Life Insurance Code of Practice is significant and is reportable to the FSC Life Code 
Compliance Committee.”

ALL 
Supporting customers with additional needs (Section 7)
Customer calls AMP and is struggling to use English. The contact centre staff member offers the use of a 
translation service for the call. The customer accepts and suggests the language they would like to 
communicate in. 
This is just one example of how we can help customers. 
I think this section should be about our 4 types of additional needs categories:
-Preference to speak in another language
-Elderly
-Disabled
-Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Perhaps we can have an activity about how we help each customer group – maybe a way of helping that is 
dragged and dropped under each group OR a flash card of a way of helping followed by a selection of the 
different groups it applies to? 
Kate is key contact for this area so can work on this together.

ALL 
Complaints (Section 9) 
Two key “minimum” timeframes for responding to complaints: 
-Respond within 90 days for policies owned by a superannuation trustee
-Respond within 45 days for policies not owned by a superannuation trustee
Reminders for staff about best ways to avoid complaints:
-Open communication with customers
-Keep well within timeframes outlined in code (e.g. timeframes for specific interactions or actions). 
-Clear written communications

Raising breaches of the Code 
I will supply you with the key contact to discuss this with – she will have a succinct blurb about this J (I don’t 
have the process offhand exactly – but basically a staff member should raise to their business leader who 
triages it up to our risk team for incident management. If needed, this committee will then raise this up to the 
breach committee who will raise it externally as required).
