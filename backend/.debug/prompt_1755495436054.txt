Scene 447: Scene 447
Paramedics should be adaptable and responsive to cultural differences in their approach to care. They should be willing to modify their practices or procedures, whenever possible and safe, to align with patients’ cultural preferences and needs.

Scene 448: Scene 448
Paramedics adapt their approach to care based on cultural differences. For instance, they may modify treatment plans to accommodate cultural practices. If a patient prefers a traditional herbal remedy alongside conventional medicine, paramedics can work collaboratively to ensure the patient's safety while respecting their cultural beliefs.​

Scene 452: Scene 452
Effective Cross-Cultural Communication skills are vital for cultural sensitivity. Paramedics should listen actively, ask open-ended questions, and be attentive to non-verbal cues. They should avoid jargon and use plain language, ensuring that patients understand the information being conveyed.

Scene 453: Scene 453
Paramedics employ effective communication skills across cultures. They may use visual aids, gestures, or cultural references to explain medical procedures or conditions when language barriers exist. They actively listen and allow patients to ask questions and express their concerns.​

How would you advise in these situations? | Case study No 1 | A team member has been feeling guilty for the past several months about a | promotion she gained over a colleague who is also a friend | She was given this | promotion because she put forward the friend‟s ideas for a new project as her own | though the friend is not aware of this | She feels this is making her „closed up‟ in her | relation to her friend | She wants to confess this error in judgment and her guilt to her | friend | Case study No 2 | Sarah and Jerry have worked on many projects for more than 2 years | and spend a | lot of time at work together | Sarah has been honest about most things and has self | disclosed to Jerry her criticisms of their boss | her fears | her insecurities | her ambitions | her home life hassles and so on | Yet Jerry doesn‟t seem to reciprocate | He almost | never shares his feelings and has told Sarah little about his home life | Sarah wonders | if she should continue to self disclose or if she should begin to limit her disclosures | Case study No 3 | Tom has been a key figure in an important roll-out | sharing the decision-making role | with Frank | Their skills are uniquely complementary and they have a history of | success in their shared projects | Tom has been offered a job in another company | which is a competitor to theirs | starting immediately | While he is keen to take the | job | he knows it will leave Frank in the lurch | Tom wants to ring Frank to resign from | the project and disclose his employment with a competitor organisation | © The Learning Factor | Adapting Your Style -

Participant Manual v | 110922 | Page | 20 | Preparation for Rapport Building | Building rapport is easier if you can prepare in advance for meeting the other | person | If possible | allow some time to consider: | What could be important to them in the long term - rely on your past | experience and any research you are able to do (e | g | asking others who | know the person well) | What is „top of mind‟ for them at the moment | What you can relate to that is similar to this person‟s situation | If you are not familiar with the person who you will be meeting | consider what | „types‟ of issues concern people in that kind of position | For example: | A Managing Director could be concerned with ROI | developing the | business | market share | competitive advantage | A Marketing Manager could be concerned with marketplace | positioning | branding | consumer sentiment | marketplace exposure | Rapport building is not difficult | however many people forget to do it and don‟t | prepare themselves before a situation where a message must be communicated | When you do this you have the advantage of rapport building and developing a | greater level of trust and respect with the people you meet | © The Learning Factor | Adapting Your Style -
