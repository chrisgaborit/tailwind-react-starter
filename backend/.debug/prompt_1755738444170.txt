Brandon Hall Standard Enforcement:
- Align total scene count to the *target scenes* from the brief (±2).
- Ensure **≥5 distinct interaction types** across the module (click-to-reveal, drag & drop, scenario/branching, role play, quiz, simulation).
- Include at least **3 branching decision points** with consequences and coaching feedback.
- Insert a **knowledge check every 3–5 scenes** (varied formats).
- End with a **capstone branching scenario** and an **action plan / commitment**.
- Every scene must include: concise narration (full script), ≤70w OST (not a VO duplicate), concrete visual **aiBrief + alt text**, interaction (if applicable), developer notes (logic, completion rule/xAPI), and **timingSeconds** estimate.
- Accessibility: captions ON, alt text, keyboard path hints and focus order guidance.

VISUAL BRIEFING RULES (apply to visual.aiBrief):
- Include **style** (Photorealistic / Vector / Flat / 3D / Abstract), **dominant & accent colours**, **subject matter** (who/what/how many), **composition/camera** (e.g., medium shot, eye-level, shallow depth), **mood/emotion**, and **brand integration** (e.g., subtle accents, motifs).
- For interactivity visuals, specify UI components, states, and animations (e.g., 5 draggable chips with labels; buttons with selected/hover states; feedback panel slide-in).
- Example for MCQ: “Question text in bold white; three large option buttons (A/B/C). Selected state adds bright border. Feedback panel animates up from bottom with subtle glow.”

INTERACTION / FEEDBACK DETAIL (developerNotes must contain):
- **[AI Action]** step-by-step behaviours (DnD success snap & lock; incorrect shake-back + hint).
- **[AI Decision Logic]** for branching (if A → go to 10A; if B → 10B; log xAPI).
- **Option-level feedback** for MCQs and **retry** logic.

USER:
You are designing a Brandon-Hall quality storyboard. Use source content faithfully, but enforce the interactivity profile and quality mandates **exactly**.

References to 'Colouring in' and 'Colour zones' have been removed, as these do not reflect ECEC principles. Instead, we have incorporated sensory-based activities that encourage children to identify emotions through body sensations and relational discussions, following Dr. Bruce Perry’s approach. Visuals must now reflect these changes by showcasing natural, calming environments and materials (e.g., bark, sand, leaves) instead of bright colours, plastic items, or abstract representations. Please review all visuals to ensure they emphasize supportive, sensory-rich settings that align with the developmental needs of children aged 0–5.\nPLEASE ALSO check that all spelling is UK English\nKeep this in mind for selection of images.\nPlease consider all images here as references and make final selections based on client feedback.\nWelcome to 'Think2Be Healthy,' the first module of our transformative course dedicated to exploring mindfulness and its pivotal role in early childhood development.

The Educators actually go out before they start the week and collect trees and bark and sand so the children can use these things to play with and maybe they would use a leaf to paint with rather than a brush. They DON’T use bright colours, they DON’T use plastics and have colourful walls or toys, its all very natural colours and things tio play with and even if they have say plastic toys they are natural colours and they use them with other natural things\nMy aspirations didn't extend beyond becoming a struggling musician.\nPresenter in the centre of the screen.\nBut today, I stand before you with a life that surpasses even my most ambitious dreams.
