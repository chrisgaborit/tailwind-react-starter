Brandon Hall Standard Enforcement:
- For Level 3 modules, include ~18–22 scenes with at least 5 distinct interaction types.
- Include at least 3 branching decision points showing consequences with coaching feedback.
- Insert a knowledge check every 3–5 scenes (varied formats).
- End with a capstone branching scenario and an action plan / commitment.
- Every scene must include: concise narration, ≤70w on-screen text (not a VO duplicate), concrete visual prompt + alt text, interaction (if applicable), developer notes (logic, completion rule, xAPI).
- Accessibility: captions ON, alt text, keyboard path hints and focus order guidance.

USER:
You are designing a Brandon-Hall quality storyboard. Use source content faithfully, but enforce the interactivity profile and quality mandates **exactly**.
