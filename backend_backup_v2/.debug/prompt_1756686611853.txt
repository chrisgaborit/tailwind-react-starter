Objctvs 
Just as the personal computer revolutionised the workplace throughout the 1980’s and 1990’s, 
recent developments in information and communication technology are forging the 
foundations of another new workplace.  This workplace is largely unconstrained by geography, 
time and organisational boundaries.  It is a virtual workplace, where productivity, flexibility and 
collaboration may unprecedented levels.
More and more, organisations are finding that their operations are decentralising, localising, 
regionalising and globalising.  
In the USA, for example, the International Telework Association and Council estimates 
that more than 28 million workers in the US – that’s more than 20% of all workers – now 
work remotely.  
In a 2007 study by the Economist Intelligence Unit (IU), almost half the firms surveyed 
reported having remote workforces; within 5 years this will be 70%.

Form small groups to consider current issues/concerns around management of remote staff.  
Include input of survey data also.
Assign each group to a F/c with one of 3 titles:
1.   Impacts of remote mgt on the business (pro’s and con’s)
2.   Organisational constraints of managing remotely (eg budget, time, time differences, 
culture)
3.   Key priorities to manage
Have each group spend 7 minutes at each F/c, brainstorming their views on the topic 
specified.
DEBRIEF:
Q.  What patterns emerge about the key issues of remote managing?
Facilitator note: Link proposed content of day to issues raised.
Facilitator note:  if the issue of trust does not arise, bring it up yourself to be added to the list.
Facilitator note:  Stimulus material for the ‘pro’s’ of remote managing could include the
following:
Potential "pluses" of remote managing to the business:
Local knowledge 
Wider talent pool, greater diversity of approaches and expertise 
Efficiencies in time/money on travel
Can grow understanding of how to work collaboratively together
Can leverage differences to trigger breakthrough thinking and innovation 
Potential benefits to the individual of being in a remote team:
An increase in colleague job satisfaction
Reduced likelihood of employee turnover
Reduced role stressors
Increased satisfaction with supervisors (who improve their management skills)
Increased commitment to the organisation

As part of this workshop, we are going to be testing the validity of these assumptions in your 
own remote management context.
Summary1 minManaging remote teams which, though it is more complex than managing a co-located 
group, has strong benefits for the business.  We have identified some of the challenges a 
remote manager faces in realising these benefits, a key one being the matter of trust.
TransitionIn discussing these issues, we’ve assumed we are talking about remote managing a team.  
Let’s query that assumption... 
SKILLS FOR MANAGING A REMOTE TEAM
30 min
What is a
team?
10 minAll of you are here because you manage people from a distance ...
Q.  Taking the new Bankwest value of “One team” into consideration, what differentiates a 
team from a work group?
Both a team and a work group are working towards shared goals, and have some level 
of inter-connectedness between members
A work group works more inter-dependently, with regular interactions and inter-
connectedness between team members to carry out the tasks required to achieve 
goals
A team is a broader collection of people, all of whom are stakeholders in some way in 
the achievement of the goals; though not necessarily directly involved in carrying out 
tasks, these stakeholders must be linked by effective communication, influenced to 
support goals and involved in varied ways to ensure success.
Q.  Would you say you actually have an efficient work group?  A team?  Why/not?
Q.  What is the value of clarifying these concepts for 
yourpeople?  
Self identifying as a member of a work group/team can give remote colleagues a sense 
of involvement and purpose that may be missing if they operate by simply “doing the 

Managing Remote Teams Facilitator Guide SessionTimingPagePPT Slide/FCDetail
job”
Q.  What do you think is the maximum optimal size of a remote work group?
The literature suggests maximum 10 people  (from the Corporate Leadership Council, 
January 2009)

Two sets of 
skills – 2 loops 
You would all be aware that, for any team, a leader must possess a standard set of 
management skills to achieve team objectives.  To be as successful as managers of co-
located teams, a remote manager needs to expand upon traditional leadership qualities.
PPT Slide 8
Traditional 
skills
Some of the main, traditional team leadership skills would be:
1.   Developing and articulating the group’s mission and objectives
2.   Mentoring team members
3.   Ensuring clear lines of communication
4.   Updating the team regularly on progress
5.   Measuring performance
PPT Slide 9
Remote skills
Some suggested management practices/skills necessary for remote managing (extending the 
tried and tested formula that works for co-located management, REACH):
1.   Emphasise 
Responsiveness – make yourself as available to remote team members as to 
local ones (eg strive to build trust from a distance)
2.   Use 
Empathy – attuning to and accepting others’ feelings and perspectives; best 
demonstrated by acknowledging – verbally or otherwise – the validity of others’ ideas, 
concerns etc (eg ‘cultural’ awareness/intelligence)
3.   Accelerate 
Accountability – building a sense of ownership for results in team members 
and the team as a whole
4.   Create 
Connection – building links between team members, the rest of the team and 
the organisation as a whole (eg precision in communication, technical know-
how/aptitude)
5.
Help – providing support for individuals’ and team’s success (eg logistical/organisational 
skills)

Form 5 small groups, assign each group to one of the REACH practices, to discuss:
What virtual team management skills are necessary, or which of the traditional skills 
need amplifying, to feed into the assigned REACH practice?
They will note these on F/c.  Before finishing, they are to identify the top 3 virtual skills on their 
list.
Allow 12 min.
DEBRIEF – 5 min
Whip round all groups for their top 3 virtual leadership/management skills.  Don’t mention any 
stated by previous small groups.
Facilitator note: See the Effective Practices for Remote Leaders in wkbk for further resources.
Transition We said earlier that trust is important to a remote team.  All these REACH practices aid the 
development of trust.  Let’s investigate further by means of a quick True/False quiz...
STRATEGIES FOR BUILDING TRUST

Trust quiz

We’ve agreed trust is important to remote relationships.  This quick group quiz will check your 
own trust-building notions...
ACTIVITY – rotating quiz on building trust
This activity is a rotating, verbal true/false quiz.  Move it along quickly.
Have participants work in small groups.  
A group will be asked a T/F question and given 20 seconds (max) to answer.  If they take too 
long, the question passes to the next group.  
Though the answers to questions must come quickly, you can allow for discussion between 
questions if appropriate to the group.  

Managing Remote Teams Facilitator Guide SessionTimingPagePPT Slide/FCDetail
Facilitator note: The “correct” T/F response can be varied if the group gives a good reason for
their response.
Questions to be asked (with suggested answers):
TrueFalse
1.Besides being costly and, sometimes, impractical, too many team 
meetings conducted face-to-face discourage the individuals from 
developing distance communication skills.

2.Explain yourself - make your actions as transparent as possible.

3.Beware too much team input on decisions.  This can confuse 
issues.

4.Carefully plan the “trickle down” effect when you communicate 
with team members.  Understand the opinion leaders and
influence-peddlers.  It is wise not to communicate simultaneously 
with everyone.

5.“Seeing is believing” - sighting colleagues in person is crucial in
developing more accurate impressions of others’ trustworthiness.

6.Disseminate as much information to as many team members as 
possible.  Information overload can be managed.

7.Be accessible and responsive.  Their priorities should become your 
priorities.

8.Let relationships between team members grow naturally through 
your various remote meetings – do not push for sharing of non-
work related information.

9.Provide photos of team members for all to see.  It helps to have a 
visual image of who you’re talking to.

10.  Feel free to explain and provide information on team operations 
to all interested outside parties.

11.  Have team members create profiles of their personal interests, 
hobbies and areas of expertise.  

12.  Agree on norms for what information can be shared within and 
outside the team.

Trust
Truisms about trust:
Is a key component in any successful relationship
Develops over time
Once lost, is hard to regain
Is related to what others need and expect
Includes giving something of yourself, being genuinely interested in the other person 
and seeing communication as a shared experience
Is best built by face-to-face interactions, the very activity that remote teams eliminate or 
severely constrain  
We’re talking about trust as a very personal phenomenon that, in management, also needs to 
apply across many people.
Thinking about how 
youcome to trust someone or something...
Q.  What is necessary for trust to develop?
Q.  What do you base your answer on?
Q.  What other comments have you about the nature of trust?
Thinking about your remote team...
Q.  How does your thinking change, if at all, when the trust needs to be built in a remote 
context, when the parties are separated by geography?
Q.  How can you cope when your team is not easily accessible, so they may not know why you 

Managing Remote Teams Facilitator Guide SessionTimingPagePPT Slide/FCDetail
do what you do?
Task-based 
and 
interpersonal-
based trust
2 minFortunately, though face-to-face interactions may be the best trust-building approach, trust is 
not always dependent on social bonds.  It can also be founded on performance consistency.  
Task-based trust, as opposed to interpersonal-based trust, may be more achievable for remote 
teams.  
Task-based trust can be built by developing norms around communication patterns, ensuring 
rapid and reliable responses, and making team interaction timely and consistent.  This intensive 
communication helps to build a coherent identity and hold the team together.
