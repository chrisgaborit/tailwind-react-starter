OPENING (FIRST FOUR, IN ORDER)
1) Title
2) Pronunciation Guide
3) Table of Contents (include a short progress note)
4) Welcome & Learning Objectives (3–5 role-tied, performance-based objectives)

CORE SCENES
- VO: ~75–150 words (~30–60s). Natural, conversational, ~140 WPM.
- OST: 5–30 words; never a verbatim VO copy (hard rule).
- Visuals: Provide an AI Visual Generation Brief (subject, setting, composition, lighting, HEX palette, mood, brand integration, negative space). Alt text is required.
- Interaction mapping:
  • lists → Flip Cards/Tabs/Accordion
  • comparison → Two-column / dual cards
  • process/timeline → Stepper/Timeline
  • components/regions → Hotspots
  • "nice-to-know" → Accordion / Learn More pop-up
- Label each scene with a scaffolding phase where appropriate: Overview / Context / KeyConcepts / Example / Application / KnowledgeCheck / Summary.
- When a targetAudience is provided, include at least one role-specific example per key concept (e.g., “Underwriter”, “Claims Assessor”).

KNOWLEDGE CHECKS
- Place a knowledge check every 3–5 scenes; mix MCQ / Scenario / Drag & Drop.
- Provide option-level feedback + retry (1–2 attempts before reveal).
- For MCQs include distractor rationales (why plausible / why wrong) per incorrect option.

CAPSTONE & CLOSE
- Capstone branching scenario with coaching feedback; allow replay to compare paths.
- xAPI verbs: responded/experienced/answered as appropriate.
- Summary (3–5 bullets); Completion statement with clear criteria; Thank you/Next steps.
- Add an Action Plan / Commitment step (short free text or checklist) when appropriate.

CROSS-CUTTING
- Brand: fonts/colours referenced in OST and visuals where useful (maintain WCAG AA contrast).
- Accessibility: captions ON; keyboard path + focus order; reduced-motion fallback.
- Timing metadata per scene + module roll-up in metadata.moduleTiming.
- Performance support: if policies or timeframes are present, include job-aids/checklists and timeframe tables in metadata.performanceSupport.

GOLDEN RATIOS
- ≥30–40% scenes interactive; ≥5 interaction types in a Level 3 module.
- KC cadence every 3–5 scenes. OST ≤ 70 words (hard cap).

SCHEMA REMINDERS
- Always include structured fields (visualGenerationBrief, overlayElements, interactionDetails with xAPI, retry/completion rules) *and* legacy mirrors (narrationScript, aiPrompt, interactionType, interactionDescription, screenLayout string).
