Scene 447: Scene 447
Paramedics should be adaptable and responsive to cultural differences in their approach to care. They should be willing to modify their practices or procedures, whenever possible and safe, to align with patients’ cultural preferences and needs.

Scene 448: Scene 448
Paramedics adapt their approach to care based on cultural differences. For instance, they may modify treatment plans to accommodate cultural practices. If a patient prefers a traditional herbal remedy alongside conventional medicine, paramedics can work collaboratively to ensure the patient's safety while respecting their cultural beliefs.​
