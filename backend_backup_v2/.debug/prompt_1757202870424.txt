Bankwest Values & Beehaviours 
The Bankwest Values and Beehaviours define leadership behaviours for our organisation – it defines 
‘how’  we  perform  our  roles.    It  is  a  framework  that  sets  out  the  behavioural  expectations  for  all 
colleagues  at  all  levels.    The  behaviours  are  aligned  to  our  Core  Values  as  shown  in  the  diagram 
below.
The  Behaviours  can  be  used  as  a  tool  to  help  you  identify  your  priorities  for  development.    By 
understanding the behaviours required at both yours and others’ levels, you’ll be able to determine 
the behaviour required to progress through the organisation.  This will help you to specifically target 
your development to help you reach your goals sooner.
All Leadership Development programs are carefully reviewed to ensure that they are delivering the 
capabilities aligned to our behaviours.

Managing Remote Teams
Time constraints and factors such as travel costs and the availability and high cost of 
specialised human expertise, have created an increased demand for organisations 
to explore the use of advance new, virtual technologies. These technologies offer a 
wide range of tools that allow team members to communicate and work as if they 
were co-located even though they may actually span a wide geography.
Just  as  the  personal  computer  revolutionised  the  workplace  throughout  the  1980’s 
and  1990’s,  recent  developments  in  information  and  communication  technology 
are  forging  the  foundations  of  another  new  workplace.  This  workplace  is  largely 
unconstrained  by  geography,  time  and  organisational  boundaries.  It  is  a  virtual 
workplace,  where  productivity,  flexibility  and  collaboration  make  unprecedented 
levels.
One  of  the  most  promising  structures  to  arise  from  this  new  workplace  is  the  virtual 
team. Virtual teams are groups of geographically and/or organisationally dispersed 
collaborators  that  are  brought  together  to  address  a  specific  task  or  an  ongoing 
function,   and   whose   members’   primary   mode   of   interaction   is   through   a 
combination of communication and information technologies.
A  wide  range  of  potential  advantages  that  organisations  might  achieve  through 
virtual or remote teamwork have been postulated.
These include:
1.   Increasing  productivity  by  enabling  simultaneous  in  addition  to  sequential 
work
2.   Improving  work  quality by  providing  members  with  continuous  access to  the 
latest and best information
3.   Increasing  the  pool  of  potential  team  members  by  allowing  members  to 
participate from their home office, or even from their homes (e.g. some tele-
workers)
4.   Decreasing organisational expenses by avoiding travel costs and downtime
5.   Increasing the impact of teamwork by capturing the work electronically so it 
can be accessed by other sections/members of the organisation as needed

None of these potential benefits come without the application of a different quality 
and   focus   by   managers   of   remote   teams.   Some   experts   suggest   that   these 
managers  should  spend  70-80%  of  their  time  (both  virtual  and  face-to-face)  with 
team members.  
Demand on Bankwest managers’ time is already high. They are increasingly required 
to be  visible, to ‘walk the floor’. The expectation  placed on these managers is  that 
they will do a lot when time is ever more limited, and to be skilled in dealing with the 
added complexity in remote venues when managing change.
*See for example, Jessica Lipnack and Jeffrey Stamps, “Virtual teams: a new way to 
work.”  Strategy and Leadership.  Jan-Feb 1999 v27, i1, pp 14-20

Francisco: Jossey-Bass
In addition, remote colleagues may be in a matrixed management situation, where 
they  report  both  to  their  direct  line  manager  as  well  as  to  a  senior  person  in  the 
remote location.  This  adds  additional  extra dimensions  and  duress into  relationships 
of both the manager and those being managed.

CULTURAL DIFFERENCES
“Cultural  differences”  can  also  impinge  on  remote  managing.  At  times  these 
differences can relate literally to people of different cultural heritages.  
For example:
The  more  direct  communication  usually  expressed  by  people  from  western 
backgrounds  compared  to  others  (e.g.  from  Japan,  Asia)  who  prefer  more 
indirect communication
The  differing  views  on  hierarchy  and  authority  held  by  different  world  or 
generational cultures
However, the term may also relate to the “cultural” differences of a different locality.  
Sydney,  for  example,  is  typically  fast-paced  and  busy,  with  a  mix  of  people  from 
other  business  units  regularly  interacting.  This  is  different  from  a  regional  office,  or 
even  another  state  headquarters  like  Perth.  “Cultural”  differences  are  also  felt  via 
such variables such as different time zones or different local public holidays.
On the other hand...
While  there  is  no  consensus  in  the  literature  regarding  the  impact  of  virtual  team 
structure  on  colleague  satisfaction,  most  studies  indicate  that  participating  in  a 
remote team environment or working from home can result in:
An increase in colleague job satisfaction
Reduced likelihood of colleague turnover
Reduced role  stressors  such  as  constant exposure to  strong personalities with 
whom they do not get along
Increased satisfaction with supervisors (who improve their management skills)
Increased commitment to the organisation

QUESTIONS
Questions a manager of a remote team may ask:
How does remoteness change group and leadership behaviours?
What is the right balance of task and team focus?
What  is  the  right  balance  of  control  and  autonomy  in  the  way  we  work 
together?
What causes divided loyalties, and what can we do about them?
Why do we need to be a team anyway?
When should we communicate, and how often is enough?
How do I manage my team when the travel budget is cut?
When should I get face-to-face, and when is it better to avoid it?
How do I stay visible when I’m remote?
What’s  the  point  in  remote  coaching?    Isn’t  it  just  more  work  when  I  don’t 
have the time?
How can I travel less without damaging my career and still get results from my 
remote team?
How can I accelerate the transfer of learning through my dispersed team?

How the team sees it
A survey of over 3000 remote and virtual team members around the globe found the 
top 5 virtual team issues are:
1.   We’re so busy with the content of what we do, we don’t spend enough time 
on the process of how we’re doing it
2.   We don’t see each other often enough
3.   The team is the wrong size
4.   The activities of the virtual team are not visible to the rest of the organisation
5.   Not everyone on the team shares the same purpose

Teams and Work Groups
One  of  the  newly-identified  values  of  Bankwest  is  that  of  “One  team”.  This  puts  a 
new perspective on the common definition of a team, which is usually:  
In Bankwest both a team and a work group are 
working  towards  shared  goals,  and  have  some 
level of inter-connectedness between members. 
However,   a   work   group   works   more   inter-
dependently, with regular interactions and inter-
connectedness  between  members  in  order  to 
carry  out  the  tasks  required  to  achieve  goals.  A 
team,  on  the  other  hand,  is  a  broader  collection  of  people,  all  of  whom  are 
stakeholders  in  some  way  in  the  achievement  of  the  goals.  Though  they  do  not 
necessarily  directly  carry  out  tasks,  these  stakeholders  must  be  linked  by  effective 
communication, influenced to support goals and involved in varied ways to ensure 
success.
Teams, particularly high performing teams, display:
Passionate dedication to shared goals
Identification and emotional bonding between team members
A   balance   between   uniformity   and   team   conformity,   and   respect   for 
individual differences
In addition, people in remote teams must be able to handle the social isolation of a 
virtual team. This requires:
Self-regulatory skills
A high level of knowledge
Comfort with technology
Interpersonal  skills  including  the  ability  to  collaborate  with  others  to  identify,  
address and resolve issues
You may not have the luxury of building your remote team “from the ground up” – in 
fact,  most  remote  teams  are  inherited.  Ideally  a  team  that  is  working  together  on 
shared projects  has functional diversity. This, of  course, can  result in  task conflict,  or 
A team is a collection of people 
who  undertake  activities  for  a 
common    purpose,    maximising 
cooperation,   commitment  and 
input.

even  interpersonal  conflict.  Knowing  the  qualities  of  an  ideal  team  will  assist  you  in 
developing  all  members  towards  it  and  to  improve  team  performance  through 
collaborative management, even in the face of conflict.
Fortunately, as a remote leader you need not learn a lot of new and different things.  
You must simply pay attention to the same familiar things in  a slightly different way.  
This means being more vigilant in picking up cues from communications about what 
is 
reallygoing  on  for  the  team,  and  being  more  purposeful  and  intentional  when 
responding
